    <h3>GDPR Disclosure:
    </h3>

    <p>If you answered "yes" to the question Does your website comply with the General Data Protection Regulation
      ("GDPR")? then the Privacy Policy above includes language that is meant to account for such compliance.
      Nevertheless,
      in order to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations your company must fulfill other requirements such as: (i)
      doing an
      assessment of data processing activities to improve security; (ii) have a data processing agreement with any third
      party
      vendors; (iii) appoint a data protection officer for the company to monitor GDPR compliance; (iv) designate a
      representative based in the EU under certain circumstances; and (v) have a protocol in place to handle a potential
      data
      breach. For more details on how to make sure your company is fully compliant with GDPR, please visit the official
      website at <a href="https://gdpr.eu.">https://gdpr.eu.</a> FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way
      responsible for determining whether or not your

      for
      any potential liability your company may face in relation to any GDPR compliance issues.</p>


    <h3>COPPA Compliance Disclosure:</h3>


    <p>This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not
      knowingly
      collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site. If this is
      not true for
      your website or online service and you do collect such information (or allow others to do so), please be aware
      that you
      must be compliant with all COPPA regulations and guidelines in order to avoid violations which could lead to law
      enforcement actions, including civil penalties.
    </p>


    <p>In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements such as:
      (i)
      posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of any others collecting
      personal
      information on your site or service — for example, plug-ins or ad networks; (ii) include a prominent link to your
      privacy
      policy anywhere you collect personal information from children; (iii) include a description of parental rights
      (e.g. that you
      won't require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary, that they can review their
      child's
      personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's
      information,
      and the procedures to exercise their rights); (iv) give parents "direct notice" of your information practices
      before
      collecting information from their children; and (v) obtain the parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting,
      using or
      disclosing personal information from a child. For more information on the definition of these terms and how to
      make sure
      your website or online service is fully compliant with COPPA please visit <a

      FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no
      way responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact compliant with COPPA and takes no
      responsibility for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential liability your company may face in
      relation
      to any COPPA compliance issues</p>
